2021/05/15 4:30pm Hao: Since we haven't been able to get the daily data of sp500, I tried playing with fbprophet on Nasdaq all time daily. But there is a issue with the plot. See the file "abnormal plot from fbprophet.ipynb". Can anyone fix it? Plus, I wanted to put these in the scratch work folder, but I don't know how to retrieve to csv data from the data folder properly (see the notebook I added in the scratch work folder). Can anyone help me?
